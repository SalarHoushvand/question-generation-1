the elements of the power set are themselves sets.A set is an unordered collection of different elements. A set can be written explicitly by listing its elements using set bracket. If the order of the elements is changed or any element of a set is repeated, it does not make any changes in the set. an apple is a fruit.Universal set contains any relevant elements and depends on application. An empty set is a subset of every set including itself.
The power set is a set of all subsets of a set. It includes the null set and also the set itself.
The power set is a set of sets.the elements of the power set are themselves sets.An ordered pair is simply a pair of objects. Ordered pairs are also called 2-tuples or sequences. 
Language modeling is the task of assigning a probability to sentences in a language.
Perfect performance at the language modeling task, namely predicting the next word in a
sequence with a number of guesses that is the same as or lower than the number of guesses required
by a human participant, is an indication of human level intelligence, and is unlikely to be achieved
in the near future.language modeling is a
crucial components in real-world applications such as machine-translation and automatic speech
recognition, where the system produces several translation or transcription hypotheses, which are
then scored by a language model. For these reasons, language modeling plays a central role in
natural-language processing, AI, and machine-learning research.The smoothing techniques are intricate and based on back off to lower-order events.this assumes a fixed backing-up order, that needs to be designed by hand, and makes it hard to add more "creative" conditioning contexts.The sequential nature of the backoff also makes it hard to scale toward larger ngrams in order to capture long-range dependencies.
